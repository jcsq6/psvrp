# Parallel Scheduling Vehicle Routing Problem

For the UTK department of transportation research

### The code is structured as follows:
---
- **Vehicle Routing Problem Library**  
	- The folder *vrp* folder holds the core library regarding all aspects of the vehicle routing problem.
- **Algorithm Exectuable**
	- The folder *algorithm* holds the code and logic for implementing and solving the PSVRP using the library defined in *vrp*
- **Tuning**: **TODO**
	- The folder *tuning* holds the code that optimizes the weights and parameters in the PSVRP
- **Testing**
	- The folder *testing* holds the code that extensively tests the VRP library (*Incomplete*)
	- It also tests the executable given several datasets (**TODO**)
